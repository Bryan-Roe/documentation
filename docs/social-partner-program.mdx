## What’s the Pieces Social Partner Program (SPP)?
Pieces is an AI-enabled productivity tool built by developers, for developers. We’re looking for above-and-beyond software engineers who are highly active on social media, stoked about new technology, and want to join a fast-growing community to help us thrive.

As a Social Partner for Pieces, you will leverage your existing presence on social media **(note: we’re currently only looking at Twitter)** to promote our products and engage with your audience. Your primary goal will be to generate maximum impressions for Pieces-related content, and to drive high-intent traffic to our website.

## How does the Pieces SPP work?
1. **Keep growing** your online presence among relevant developer communities through authentic engagement, insightful posts, and genuine interactions.
2. **Advocate for Pieces** where it makes sense, bringing us up naturally throughout your daily interactions and advocating for our technology/products.
3. **Get paid and win swag** based on your reach, number of mentions, and new site visitors to pieces.app via a unique referral link.


## Key responsibilities:
- Continue with your own general content creation and interactions online, ideally leaning into development-related content particularly around developer tools and AI applications
- Create engaging content about Pieces for Developers, showcasing its features, benefits, and use cases
- Share and repost content from the main Pieces accounts and other developer advocates, incorporating them seamlessly into your feed and stories.
- Implement a UTM link provided by Pieces in your bio and/or content to track traffic and measure campaign performance.
- Engage with your audience and related profiles by responding to comments, messages, and inquiries related to Pieces and its functionalities, and proactively through likes, retweets, comments and other interactions to drive interest about Pieces and grow your personal following.

We’re looking for at least a 1-month partnership to start, aiming for at least 5 mentions of Pieces in some format each week (we can discuss best practices after applying).

## Who we’re looking for

If you have:
- An established presence on Twitter (at least 1k followers) and engage with your followers and the broader development community on a daily basis
- Strong communication skills with the ability to create compelling content that resonates with your audience
- A passion for technology, productivity tools, and software development, with an understanding of the target audience
- A general background in software development: Coding tools, frameworks, languages and trends
- An interest in Pieces for Developers

We’d love to work with you!

## Why work for Pieces?
We’re a friendly group of passionate developers and creators looking to build an amazing community around our cutting-edge AI technologies, open source software, and integrations that EVERY developer can use!

Part of building a product that developers love is ingraining ourselves in communities and providing solutions to even the most complex problems. As part of our Social Partner Program, you get to join other technical advocates who are passionate about helping others and growing something that people can feel a part of. Plus, you can work directly with the Pieces team with support every step of the way.
