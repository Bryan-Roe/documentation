# Captured Context

The Captured Context feature in Pieces Desktop App is designed to enhance developer productivity by providing contextual information and insights based on your recent activities. This feature helps you maintain focus, reduce context switching, and streamline your workflow.


## How It Works

### Saving Context
When you save code snippets or documents with Pieces, the Captured Context feature stores metadata such as the origin URL, tags, title, annotations, and more. This metadata is used to provide contextual insights and quick access to your recent activities.

### Viewing Context
You can view your captured context in the Pieces desktop app or through other integrations. Simply open the app and navigate to the Captured Context section to see a list of your recent activities and the contextual information associated with them.

### Sharing Context
Captured Context allows you to share useful information with your team. By generating shareable links, you can easily share code snippets, documents, and other contextual information without having to copy and paste.

## Benefits

### Improved Productivity
By reducing context switching and providing quick access to recent activities, Captured Context helps you maintain focus and improve productivity.
