Ahead of time compilation (AOT compilation) is a process in software development where programs are compiled into native machine code before runtime. This contrasts with [Just-in-Time (JIT) compilation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just-in-time_compilation), where code is compiled during the execution of the program.

## How AOT Works

AOT compilation translates program code into a lower-level code that the system's processor can directly execute. The process typically occurs during the build phase of an application, ensuring that the code is already optimized and ready to run at launch. An AOT build can target various languages and platforms, including high-level languages like Java or systems like .NET and Angular.

## Benefits of AOT Compilation

* **Reduced startup time** - Using AOT compile significantly reduces the time it takes for applications to start up by eliminating the need for runtime compilation, which is particularly beneficial for mobile and embedded devices where quick startup is crucial.
* **Optimized performance** - Compiling to native code ahead of time means AOT compilers can apply more aggressive optimization techniques that might be too costly to perform at runtime with JIT compilers.
* **Consistent execution** - Without the need to compile code on the fly, AOT-compiled applications can offer more predictable performance, which is advantageous in environments where stability and reliability are paramount.

## Drawbacks of AOT Compilation

* **Limited flexibility** - AOT compilers make optimization decisions at compile time, lacking the ability to adapt to runtime conditions. This can sometimes result in less efficient execution when comparing AOT vs JIT compilers that optimize based on actual usage patterns.
* **Compatibility issues** - AOT compilation can lead to compatibility issues across different operating systems or environments if the application is not meticulously targeted and tested. This is because the compiled code is tightly coupled with the system's architecture.
* **Complexity in development** - Using AOT compilation can complicate the development process, as it requires more detailed management of dependencies and environment configurations. Additionally, some dynamic features like reflection and late binding might be restricted or require additional handling

## Key Takeaways

* **Choose wisely** - Understanding when to use a just in time compiler vs ahead of time compilation can greatly benefit application deployment and execution, especially in resource-constrained environments where performance and startup time are critical.
* **Testing and compatibility** - Due to potential compatibility issues, extensive testing is crucial when deploying AOT-compiled applications across different platforms or architectures.
* **Balance with JIT** - In some scenarios, a combination of JIT and AOT compilation might offer the best balance between startup performance and runtime optimization, allowing applications to leverage the strengths of both compilation methods.

As you can see, AOT compilation is a powerful tool for enhancing application performance, especially in constrained environments, thanks to the reduction in application startup time and runtime overhead. Since the compilation occurs before runtime, AOT-compiled applications can start and run faster, which makes them ideal for environments where performance is critical.
