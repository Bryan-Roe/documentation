# Link Time Optimization

Link Time Optimization (LTO) is a program optimization technique executed by compilers during the linking stage. It aims to improve runtime performance and reduce the final size of executable programs. This technique is particularly relevant for programming languages that compile files separately and then link them, such as C and Fortran, but it is also beneficial for newer languages.

During the linking phase, LTO analyzes and optimizes the entire program as a single module, rather than as individual compilation units. This comprehensive view allows the compiler to perform more global optimizations like function inlining across different modules and removing unused code.

## Benefits of Link Time Optimization

* **Improved Performance** - LTO allows for advanced optimizations like function inlining across different compilation units and aggressive dead code elimination, resulting in faster execution times.
* **Reduced Binary Size** - By removing unused code and optimizing what remains, LTO can significantly reduce the size of the final executable, which is beneficial for memory-constrained environments.
* **Enhanced Error Detection** - The comprehensive analysis of the entire program at the link stage can help detect errors and inefficiencies that might not be visible at the individual compilation unit level.

## Drawbacks of Link Time Optimization

* **Increased Build Time** - LTO processes the entire program as a single unit, which can lead to significantly longer compilation times, particularly noticeable in large projects.
* **Higher Memory Usage** - The extensive nature of LTO's optimizations requires more memory during the build process, which might be problematic for systems with limited resources.
* **Compatibility Issues** - Ensuring that all tools in the build chain (compilers, linkers, debuggers) properly support LTO can be challenging, especially when different versions of these tools are involved.

## Key Takeaways

* **Select the Right Mode** - Depending on the size and requirements of your project, choose between Full LTO for maximum optimization and ThinLTO for a balance between build time and optimization.
* **Toolchain Support** - Before implementing LTO, verify that your entire toolchain is compatible with LTO to avoid build failures and to ensure that optimizations are effectively applied.
* **Resource Management** - Consider the resource availability for your build environment, as LTO can substantially increase memory and CPU usage during builds. Adjusting the scope of LTO (e.g., using ThinLTO) can help manage these resource demands.

LTO plays a crucial role in performance optimization by allowing whole-program analysis and optimization at the link stage, which is not possible with regular compilation. This can lead to significant performance improvements, such as faster execution and responsiveness in software applications. For instance, the Arm Compiler 6 utilizes LTO to enhance performance across a range of benchmarks, achieving an average performance boost of [around 10%](https://community.arm.com/arm-community-blogs/b/tools-software-ides-blog/posts/achieving-best-performance-using-link-time-optimization-in-arm-compiler-6).

Implementing LTO can be highly beneficial for the performance and size optimization of your software projects, but it requires careful consideration of the associated costs and setup requirements.
