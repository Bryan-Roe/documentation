qGPT is a quantized version of the Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) language model. Quantization is a technique that reduces the size and computational cost of a neural network model by reducing the precision of its weights. qGPT can be used for a variety of tasks, such as text generation, language translation, and question answering.
