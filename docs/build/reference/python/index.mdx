## Introduction
The Pieces SDK is a powerful code engine package designed for writing applications on top of [Pieces OS](/installation-getting-started/what-am-i-installing). It facilitates communication with a locally hosted server to enable features such as copilot chats, asset saving, and more.

## Requirements
The Pieces SDK has the following system requirements:

- [Pieces OS](/installation-getting-started/what-am-i-installing) running as a backend service.
- [Python environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) with pip for installing the SDK package.

## Installation
To get started with the Pieces SDK, follow these steps:

1. **Download Pieces OS**: Pieces OS serves as the primary backend service, providing essential functionality for the SDK. Download the appropriate version for your operating system:

    <GridFlexRow type={'start'}>
      <CTAButton
      href="/installation-getting-started/windows"
      label={"Get Pieces for Windows"}
      icon={'/assets/windows_logo_old.png'}
      type={'secondary'}
      />
      <CTAButton
      href="/installation-getting-started/macos"
      label={"Get Pieces for macOS"}
      icon={'/assets/mac_os.png'}
      iconDark={'/assets/mac_os_dark.png'}
      type={'secondary'}
      />
      <CTAButton
      href="/installation-getting-started/linux"
      label={"Get Pieces for Linux"}
      icon={'/assets/linux_logo.png'}
      type={'secondary'}
      />
    </GridFlexRow>

2. **Install the PyPI Package**: Use pip to install the Pieces SDK package:
    ```shell
    pip install pieces-os-client==1.2.7
    ```

:::warning

Ensure that you install `v1.2.7` of the Pieces SDK package to ensure compatibility with the latest version of Pieces OS.

We are working on a fix for this but for now, please install the package with that specific version number.

:::

## Getting Started

First, we will create a Python script to test the connection to the Pieces OS server. This involves creating a `config.py` file to store your configuration info and a `wellknown.py` file to test the connection.

:::info

It's important to note that the localhost port for Pieces OS is different based on the operating system.

For Linux, you should use `localhost:5323`.

For macOS and Windows, you should use `localhost:1000`.

:::

Create a `main.py` file and add this code to confirm you have installed the correct package:

```python title="main.py"
import pieces_os_client
import platform

# Defining the port based on the operating system. For Linux, the port is 5323, and for macOS/Windows, the port is 1000.
platform_info = platform.platform()
if 'Linux' in platform_info:
    port = 5323
else:
    port = 1000

# The `basePath` defaults to http://localhost:1000, however we need to change it to the correct port based on the operating system.
configuration = pieces_os_client.Configuration(host=f"http://localhost:{port}")

# Initialize the Pieces ApiClient
api_client = pieces_os_client.ApiClient(configuration)

# Enter a context with an instance of the ApiClient
with pieces_os_client.ApiClient(configuration) as api_client:
    # Create an instance of the WellKnownApi class
    api_instance = pieces_os_client.WellKnownApi(api_client)

    try:
        # Retrieve the (wellknown) health of the Pieces OS
        api_response = api_instance.get_well_known_health()
        print("The response of WellKnownApi().get_well_known_health:")
        print(api_response) # Response: ok
    except Exception as e:
        print("Exception when calling WellKnownApi->get_well_known_health: %s\n" % e)
```

Run the following command to execute the script:

```shell
python3 main.py
```

## Next Steps

If you've made it this far, that means you've successfully connected to your local Pieces OS server using our Python SDK! You can now explore the various endpoints available in the SDK to build your application on top of Pieces OS.
