# ReferencedModel

*****NOTE:***** This is the basic referencedModel, for Now since we dont have a FlattenedModel, im going to simply not include the reference, because I do NOT want to attach a Model here (would cause breaking changes if we switched from a Model -> a flattenedModel). and (2) we are under going Model changes to the Model, so would cause issues.

## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**var_schema** | [**EmbeddedModelSchema**](EmbeddedModelSchema) |  | [optional] 
**id** | **str** |  |
