```typescript
import * as Pieces from '@pieces.app/pieces-os-client'

const configuration = Pieces.Configuration()
const apiInstance = new Pieces.ConnectorApi(configuration)

const body: Pieces.SuggestRequest = {
    // string
    application: application_example,
    // SeededConnectorCreation | This is the Snippet that we will compare to all the saved assets to determine what we want to do with it! (optional)
