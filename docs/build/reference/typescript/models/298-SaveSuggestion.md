# SaveSuggestion

This is the SaveSuggestion. Mainly creating an additional model here because I imagine that we will want to add some additional data to this in the future (potentially with more numerical data that is emitted from the ML Models)  **Note: suggested is required here because we will want to say if we reccomend to take this action of save or not.

## Properties

Name | Type
------------ | -------------
**schema** | [**EmbeddedModelSchema**](EmbeddedModelSchema)
**suggested** | **boolean**
