# Onboarding New Developers, Reducing Technical Debt, & Code Reviews

Developers continuously have to navigate ever-growing code bases, backlog tasks, Jira Tickets, GitHub Issues, and Pull Requests, all in an effort to reuse existing code, onboard new developers faster, share relevant examples, reduce technical debt, and drive code standardization.

Powered by our On-Device Suggested Save and On-Device Pattern Engine, the [Pieces for Developers JetBrains Plugin](/extensions-plugins/jetbrains) can automatically recognize and save highly reusable, yet complimentary materials for you.

Leverage the [Pieces for Developers Desktop App](/installation-getting-started/what-am-i-installing) to discover and extract reusable boilerplate through our [In-Project Snippet Discovery](/product-highlights-and-benefits/in-project-snippet-discovery) features, which run entirely offline and on-device.
