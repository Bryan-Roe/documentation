# Resurfacing Additional Context in Collaborative Environments

Task and project context regarding the who, what, where, and why is often discussed over a variety of channels such as Email, Slack, Teams, Discord, Community Forums, Twitter, Reddit, and more.

Keeping track of this critical context - decision outcomes, architectures, implementation solutions, best practices, power tips, configs - is becoming harder than ever.

When you save code snippets, Pieces for Developers internally leverages our unique [Context Awareness Engine](/features/auto-enrichment#saving-a-snippets-origin-information) to automatically extract and associate over 15 metadata heuristics.

The Pieces for Developers Desktop App enables you to [Toggle Realtime and Scope-Relevant Suggestions](/features/global-search#suggested-searches) around materials to save, reference, reuse, and share.
